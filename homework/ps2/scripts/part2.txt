----------------------------------------------
1. The message is "attack at dawn"

2.To prevent the previous attack, the messenger can add some random bits to the message:
(1) It will increase the message space since the attacker will not know the random bits (with k random bits,
the message space is 3 * 2**k)
(2) It will make the message longer and protect against small plaintext attacks (see next question)
